This project entails using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage that has a sketchpad on it. This sketchpad should consist of 16x16 div boxes that, once a mouse hovers over them, fill in, therefore acting like a sketchpad. The main challenge of this project is that the different required elements should be added with DOM manipulation rather than hard coding them in to the HTML. Therefore, by the end of this project, I will have demonstrated skills in JavaScript, specifically with DOM manipulation.
